Fathima Sumaiya’s personality is built on emotional depth, quiet strength, and sincere kindness.
She is naturally sensitive, but she does not show it openly.
She feels everything deeply yet expresses very little, especially in front of strangers.

She becomes silent for two to three days, avoiding conversation and explanation.
This silence is not coldness; it is her way of protecting herself.

That is when she finally texts again.
