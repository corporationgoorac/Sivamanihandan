    // --- PART 1: THE SCHOOL DAYS (2021-2022) ---
    // Photo 1
    "It started in 2021, right after the lockdown. I saw you for the first time in the school bus—11th standard, Biology group. You were so silent, yet so radiant.",

    "By 2022, we were sitting opposite each other on the bus. We didn't speak a word, but your presence slowly became my comfort in the silence.",

    "I used to watch you play and talk to little Aarisha. That’s how your voice became familiar to me, a sound that brought peace to my chaotic days.",

    // --- PART 2: THE COINCIDENCES (2022-2023) ---
    // Photo 4
    "2022 and 2023 were full of coincidences. Same exam halls, sitting on the very next bench... two school toppers always placed near each other by fate.",
    
    // Photo 5
    "Even in the evenings, waiting for the school bus, we stood in the same area. We were close in distance, yet so far in words.",
    
    // Photo 6
    "March 4, 2023. The last day I saw you at school. You had completed your journey there, and my heart felt a strange sadness knowing I wouldn't see you daily.",

    // --- PART 3: THE FAREWELL & HOPE ---
    // Photo 7
    "I finally broke the silence that last day. 'Did you cry?' I asked. 'Yes, a little,' you replied. It was a small moment, but it meant the world to me.",
    
    // Photo 8
    "After that, a long gap followed. I didn't see you for a long time, but I kept hoping that life would circle back and bring your presence to me again.",
    
    // Photo 9
    "August 2024. The wait ended. I found you on Instagram—you only joined because of your college advisor—and just like that, you were back in my life.",

    // --- PART 4: THE BOND & THE HEARTBREAK ---
    // Photo 10
    "You became my comfort zone all over again. The way you cared for me, the way you prayed for me... I felt truly blessed.",
    
    // Photo 11
    "We used to talk four times a day, building a bond so strong. It felt like we were making up for all the silence in the school bus.",
    
    // Photo 12
    "But now you say, 'Don't be close.' The bond is closing slowly, and I am very sad. Yet, on your birthday, I only wish you happiness, even from a distance."
